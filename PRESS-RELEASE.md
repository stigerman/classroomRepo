There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  HelpTeach

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  A private direct communicaton platform for teachers and guardians to talk without relying on students to be messengers.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  HelpTeach is a free tool for primary school teachers to maintain open lines of communication with the guardians of their students. In K - 6th grade, teachers regularly send kids home with important messages in the form of fliers and hand written notes. Unsuprisingly, many of our kids do not quite get those messages home in a timely fashion if ever. HelpTeach allows a teacher to upload that flier to her account in a private cloud, then share it to her students' guardians. Additionally, it can be difficult to keep guardians up to speed as things move so fast day to day in classrooms. So HelpTeach provides a classroom activity feed, photo gallery, dynamic class calendar, and a wishlist for each class.  HelpTeach is a bridge over the communication gap between teachers and the guardians of the children they teach.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  How do you keep all of the guardians for all of your students up to date with the cute, cool, and crucial? Most teachers simply accpet that it is not possible. Some create private facebook groups or rely on other imperfect methods.  

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  HelpTeach allows teachers to both upload and dispatch the information they deem cute, cool, and/or crucial to guardians. Teachers can dispatch to all guardians for their classroom or privately to specific guardian(s).  Each time the teacher dispatches any non sms message an automated sms alert is sent to the recipient guardian(s).

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "It is easy to say to teachers from the outside that they just need more parental involvement. Furthermore, how and with what free time should teachers manage that ongoing engagement process? HelpTeach is like the virtual assistant 21st century teachers need but have not been afforded. Our goal is to deliver something intuitive and flexible." - jblaze 

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  Getting started is by invitation-only. This is something designed specifically for teachers, so teachers must be invited to use the tool by another teacher. Teacher's can simply sign up with an email or phone number and a password. Teacher's chose a username and began creating their classrooms. Teacher's add thier class roster to the classroom then invite the guardians into the classroom. Guardians sign up with an email or phone number and password and then select their students by classroom. Guardians can only access a classroom's information after a teacher has created the classroom, invited the guardian to it, and the guardian has selected their student(s). 
 
## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "Last year, I was having a big problem getting back permission slips for field trips that I know my kids wanted to attend. I'd call home and more often than not the slips never made it home. Now with HelpTeach all of my kids' guardians can see our class calendar and see upcoming field trips.  Additionally, now I can send the slips home digitally with a click as well as with the kids. As you can imagine clicking my mouse is way easier than trying to chase down the guardians for 20 kids one at a time." - Amy Smith, Reach Academy

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
